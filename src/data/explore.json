We define a successful data analysis as the\nmatching of principles between the analyst and the audience on which the\nanalysis is developed. In this paper, we propose a statistical model and\ngeneral framework for evaluating the success of a data analysis.

For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences\nin how a data analyst constructs or creates a data analysis, including\ndifferences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. In addition, data\nanalysts can prioritize (or not) certain objective characteristics in a data\nanalysis, leading to differences in the quality or experience of the data\nanalysis, such as an analysis that is more or less reproducible or an analysis\nthat is more or less exhaustive. However, data analysts currently lack a formal\nmechanism to compare and contrast what makes analyses different from each\nother. To address this problem, we introduce a vocabulary to describe and\ncharacterize variation between data analyses. We denote this vocabulary as the\nelements and principles of data analysis, and we use them to describe the\nfundamental concepts for the practice and teaching of creating a data analysis.\nThis leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data\nanalyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to\nteach students how to build data analyses.",
