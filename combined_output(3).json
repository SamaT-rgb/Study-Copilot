The use of sensors allows patients to\nbe monitored over a period of time with a high observation frequency.

One of the popular approaches in\nthe analysis of wearable sensor data is functional data analysis.

Previously,\nwe defined a set of principles for describing data analyses that can be used to\ncreate a data analysis and to characterize the variation between data analyses.\nHere, we introduce a metric of quality evaluation that we call the success of a\ndata analysis, which is different than other potential metrics such as\ncompleteness, validity, or honesty. We define a successful data analysis as the\nmatching of principles between the analyst and the audience on which the\nanalysis is developed. In this paper, we propose a statistical model and\ngeneral framework for evaluating the success of a data analysis. We argue that\nthis framework can be used as a guide for practicing data scientists and\nstudents in data science courses for how to build a successful data analysis.",

For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences\nin how a data analyst constructs or creates a data analysis, including\ndifferences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. In addition, data\nanalysts can prioritize (or not) certain objective characteristics in a data\nanalysis, leading to differences in the quality or experience of the data\nanalysis, such as an analysis that is more or less reproducible or an analysis\nthat is more or less exhaustive. However, data analysts currently lack a formal\nmechanism to compare and contrast what makes analyses different from each\nother. To address this problem, we introduce a vocabulary to describe and\ncharacterize variation between data analyses. We denote this vocabulary as the\nelements and principles of data analysis, and we use them to describe the\nfundamental concepts for the practice and teaching of creating a data analysis.\nThis leads to two insights: it suggests a formal mechanism to evaluate data\nanalyses based on objective characteristics, and it provides a framework to\nteach students how to build data analyses.",

The past quarter century has seen remarkable progress in the field of light microscopy for biomedical science, with new imaging technologies coming on the market at an almost annual basis. Most of the data generated by these systems is image-based, and there is a significant increase in the content and throughput of these imaging systems. This, in turn, has resulted in a shift in the literature on biomedical research from descriptive to highly-quantitative. Standard and Super-Resolution Bioimaging Data Analysis satisfies the demand among students and research scientists for introductory guides to the tools for parsing and processing image data. Extremely well illustrated and including numerous examples, it clearly and accessibly explains what image data is and how to process and document it, as well as the current resources and standards in the field. A comprehensive guide to the tools for parsing and processing image data and the resources and industry standards for the biological and biomedical sciences Takes a practical approach to image analysis to assist scientists in ensuring scientific data are robust and reliable Covers fundamental principles in such a way as to give beginners a sound scientific base upon which to build Ideally suited for advanced students having only limited knowledge of the mathematics, statistics and computing required for image data analysis An entry-level text written for students and practitioners in the bioscience community, Standard and Super-Resolution Bioimaging Data Analysis de-mythologises the vast array of image analysis modalities which have come online over the past decade while schooling beginners in bioimaging principles, mathematics, technologies and standards."
